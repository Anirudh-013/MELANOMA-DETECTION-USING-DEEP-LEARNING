# MELANOMA-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Detecting melanoma based on the images in data

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

For achieving the desired classification. The following steps have been performed:

1.Data Reading into system and identifying necessary libraries to import.
2.Model Building & training
3.Data augmentation
4.Model Building & training
5.Handling class imbalances
6.Model Building & training


After performing the model building for multiple times, model with reasonably accuracy has been obtained.
